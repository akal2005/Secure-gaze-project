Secure gaze Description

Secure Gaze is an authentication system of graphical passwords based on Java to enhance digital security by preventing shoulder-surfing attacks. Instead of typing text passwords, the user will select visual elements like colors, letters, and numbers to log in securely. Each login session will be dynamic and randomized; hence, even if someone observes the screen, he will not be able to reproduce the password pattern. The project demonstrates how Java programming can work in tandem with database integration and security logic to provide a more secure login.
